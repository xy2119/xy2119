🎓 I am a Master of Engineering student at Imperial College London. 

💻 My research experinces extended to Imperial College Data Science Institute and currently is a member of Algorithmic Human Development Group at Department of Computing.

💊 Most of my research is within Biomedicine and Healthcare, including Biomedical Image Segmentation, Biomedical Knowledge Graph Construction, and Sentimental Analysis on patients diaries.

🦾 I worked with Machine Learning Engineers at Alipay to implement Graph Neural Networks for uses in causal analysis of market schemes and the building of a recommendar system. We have submitted papers to top conferences and some of them are being reviewed.

🧬 Currently, I am working proactively on my master thesis about Geometric Deep Learning for Protein Design!!! Experiments about Equivariant Representation on ProteinMPNN can be found here.

🌱 As an AI enthusiast and problem-solver, I head a team proposing AI-based solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals. The UNDP judging panel has chosen our mental healthcare initiative as one of the top 10 finalists out of 200+ teams.

💬 Also, I am hosting a weekly paper reading group, sharing Graph Transformers for biomolecule tasks with researchers from the fields of Computing, Medicine and Pharmaceutics. My GNNs notebooks are here.
