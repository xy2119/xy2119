🎓 I am a Master of Engineering student at Imperial College London.(2019-2023)

💻 I am a member of the [Algorithmic Human Development Group](http://humandevelopment.doc.ic.ac.uk) at the Department of Computing, and my research experinces extended to Imperial College Data Science Institute where I have worked on projects related to biomedical data science.

💊 My research focuses on the application of machine learning to biomedicine and healthcare, including projects on biomedical image segmentation, biomedical knowledge graph construction, and sentimental analysis of patient diaries.

🦾 I worked with Machine Learning Engineers at Alipay to implement Graph Neural Networks for uses in causal inference analysis of market schemes and the building of a recommendar system. 

🧬 I am currently working on my master thesis on the application of geometric deep learning to protein design! Check out my experiments on SO(3)-Invariant Representation on ProteinMPNN. [link to project](https://github.com/xy2119/SO3_Equivariant_ProteinMPNN)

💬 Also, I am hosting a weekly paper reading group, sharing Graph Transformers on molecular representation learnning with researchers from the fields of Computing, Medicine, Pharmaceutics etc. [link to notebooks](https://github.com/xy2119/BioKR2_Graph_Transformer)

🌱 I lead a team of AI enthusiasts working on proposals for AI-based solutions to the Sustainable Development Goals. Our healthcare initiative was selected as a top 10 finalist out of 200+ teams by the UNDP judging panel.
