🎓 I am a Master of Engineering student at Imperial College London. 

💻 My research experinces extended to Imperial College Data Science Institute and currently is a member of Algorithmic Human Development Group at Department of Computing.

💊 Most of my research is within Biomedicine and Healthcare, including Biomedical Image Segmentation, Biomedical Knowledge Graph Construction, and Sentimental Analysis on patients diaries.

🦾 I worked with Machine Learning Engineers at Alipay to implement Graph Neural Networks for use in causal analysis of market schemes and the building of a recommendar system. We have submitted papers to top conferences and some of them are being reviewed.

💬 Currently, I am working proactively on my master thesis about Geometric Deep Learning for Protein Design!!! Experiments about Equivariant Representation on ProteinMPNN can be found

🌱 As an AI enthusiast and problem-solver, I head a team proposing AI-based solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals. The UNDP judges chosen our mental health care initiative as one of the top 10 finalists out of more than 200 teams.

🧬 Also, I am hosting a weekly paper reading group, sharing Graph Transformers for biomolecules with researchers from fields of Computing, Medicine and Pharmaceutics. My GNN notebooks are here.
