Hello there 👋🏻, my name is Xinyan Ye.

🎓 I am a MEng student at Imperial College London. 

💻 My research experinces extended to Imperial College Data Science Institute and currently is a member of Algorithmic Human Development Group at Department of Computing. Most of my research projects fall into the categories of Biomedicine and Healthcare, including Biomedical Image Segmentation, Biomedical Knowledge Graph Construction, and Sentimental Analysis on patients diaries.

🦾 I worked with Machine Learning Engineers at Alipay, contributed to causal analysis of market schemes and recommendar system construction by implenmenting Graph Neural Networks. We have submitted papers to top conferences and some of them are under review.

💬 Currently, I am working proactively on my master thesis about Geometric Deep Learning for Protein Design!!! I will be experimenting Equivariant Representation on ProteinMPNN!!!

🌱 As a AI enthusiast and a problem solver, I lead a team to proposed AI-based solutions for Sustainable Development Goals. Our mental healthcare project has been selected as top 10 finalist by the UNDP judging panel standing out of 200+ teams.

💡 Also, I am hosting a weekly reading group, sharing paper reviews on Graph Transformers and E(3) Equivariant Neural Networks for proteins and molecules. This BioR^2 is a group of researchers coming from Computing, Medicine and Pharmaceutics. In this repo you can find a portfolio of my GNN notebooks.
